# Console-Based ATM with Java

The simple ATM written in Java is a software application that simulates the functionality of an ATM machine. The application allows users to withdraw, deposit, and view their account balance. It also allows user validation through ATM number and PIN input.

The system is designed to showcase unit testing, which involves using a suite of tests to ensure that the application works as expected and that any future changes will not cause unexpected issues.
## Features

- Check available balance
- Withdraw amount
- Deposit amount
- View account statement 


## Prerequisites

To install and run the application, the following tools must be installed first:
- [Java 17 or higher](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
- Any integrated development environment (IDE) that can run Java, such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)

If you want to use VS Code as your IDE, you can [install the Coding Pack for Java](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/java-tutorial), which includes VS Code, the Java Development Kit (JDK), and essential Java extensions.
